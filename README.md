### Project Description

The Burger app was created for a restaurant to allow users to select from a list of burgers they would like to eat. When a user selects and submits a burger from the dropdown menu, then a list will display of the selected burgers they would like to order in the Your Current Order section. Each burger in the Your Current Order area has a "Devour it!" button that when the user clicks it the burger moves over to the right side of the page. The app stores the burgers that have been selected in a database and indicates if it has been devoured or not. 

#### User Story

As a restuarant owner
I want an app that will help my guests to be able to order burgers and keep track of how many they eat
so that I can manage daily production and food cost.
